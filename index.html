            <p  class="info"> Hi. My name is Lara Hocheiser. I am a multi-talented professional with expertise in web marketing, content strategy and creation, product, education, and health and wellbeing. As a business owner, I was a product owner, lead the marketing efforts, facilitated courses, and built a recognizable, trusted brand. My SEO skills are such that I was given two contracts with a major publisher last year for nonfiction books in my expertise, yoga and mindfulness education.

              I am seeking opportunities in web marketing, product management, business analysis, and content management. 
              
              I recently became full-stack software engineer certified because of my interest in joining a small to medium tech start up in the health, education, or sustainability fields.  </p>

            <p  class="info"> Hi. I am Lara Hocheiser, a software developer, author, and educator. I am seeking opportunities to use my strong verbal and written communication, people, technology, and entrepreneur skillsets to help an amazing tech company build or improve its product. I'd love to explore roles as a Project manager, Software engineer, Full-stack or Frontend developer, Technical writer, or Instructor. Because I have run my own small business for ten years and have varied skills, I think I would land best in a startup that may need me as a software engineer, but enjoy the project manager and communicator aspects of myself. I want to help you achieve your company's goals because I get a deep thrill from getting things done! I have ADHD which means I don't do great on interview technical assessments (please consider allowing me to show work I've done or get reasonable accomodations) yet I thrive on deadline </p>

            <h5> Software Engineer, Various Projects | 01/2022 - present</h5> 
            <p class=" p-resume"> Some of my favorite accomplishments have been working on the projects and collaborations I have completed over the past 6 months in software development. From building a Kanye West quote game with JS, to building a health and wellness app steeped in scientific research in Ruby, to a full-stack multi-page web app with a complex dataset from an external API using Ruby on Rails backend and React.Js frontend, where I could track all the Vonnegut books I've read and favorite, take notes, and mark as read, it's been a blast. Most recently, I went down a React.JS rabbithole and built 7 classic features in a day including a timer, a tic tac toe game, mapping data and rendering it, and more. I am looking forward to supporting a team with these varied web development skills. </p>
            <h5 >Founder, Flow and Grow Kids Yoga | 09/2012 - present</h5>
            <div>
              <p class="p-resume" >In 2012, I launched a community-based yoga and mindfulness education company. Over the next ten years, I expanded services to include professional development, teacher training, content sales(PDF sales of curriculum and children's education materials), a free prolific and award-winning blog, a multi-state and later multi-national career-track school, and ultimately to being one of the most sought out online teacher to cohort children's yoga schools, recognized by the Yoga Alliance as exceeding standards. At its peak, without ads, my eCommerce site had 5,000 unique monthly visitors. I hired more than 20 staff members including teaching artists, assistants, marketing AND AD AGENCIES, and a graphic designer that worked for me for 6 years. I trained more than 500 adults, mentored more than 35 adults, worked with over 50 schools, and taught more than 10,000 children. </p>
